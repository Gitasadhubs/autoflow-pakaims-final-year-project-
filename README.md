## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Secure GitHub Integration**: Authenticate securely using a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` and `workflow` scopes. Your token is stored exclusively in your browser.
*   **Real-time Repository Fetching**: Instantly view and filter through all your public and private repositories.
*   **Dynamic Workflow Management**: Automatically discover all active workflows (`.yml` files) within your selected repository.
*   **One-Click Workflow Triggering**: Manually run any workflow configured with a `workflow_dispatch` event directly from the UI.
*   **Live Log Streaming**: Monitor your workflow runs in real-time with a live-updating log viewer that streams output directly from the GitHub API.
*   **Intelligent Workflow Generation**: Create complete, production-ready CI/CD pipelines for Vercel and Railway with a single click using pre-built templates.
*   **Modern & Responsive UI**: Enjoy a clean, GitHub-inspired interface with a collapsible sidebar, light/dark modes, and a focus on usability.
*   **Detailed Run Views**: Get comprehensive details for each workflow run, including status, conclusion, trigger information, and links to GitHub.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run AutoFlow on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js**: Version 16.x or later.
*   **npm** or **yarn**: A package manager for Node.js.
*   **A GitHub Account**

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/autoflow.git
cd autoflow
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

AutoFlow requires a PAT to communicate with the GitHub API.

1.  Navigate to the **[New Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)** page on GitHub.
2.  Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "AutoFlow Access").
3.  Set an expiration date.
4.  Ensure the following scopes are selected:
    *   ‚úÖ **`repo`**: Grants full control of private repositories. Required for reading repo data and creating workflow files.
    *   ‚úÖ **`workflow`**: Grants permission to add and modify GitHub Actions workflows. Required for triggering workflow runs.
5.  Click **"Generate token"** and copy the token. **You will not be able to see it again.**

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm run start # Assumes a start script is defined in package.json
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. Paste your GitHub PAT into the login field to begin using AutoFlow.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

AutoFlow is a client-side application that interacts directly with the GitHub API. There is no backend server or database; all data is fetched in real-time and your token is stored securely in your browser's local storage.

*   **Authentication**: Upon login, the PAT is stored in `localStorage`. Every subsequent API request includes this token in the `Authorization` header.
*   **Data Fetching (`services/githubService.ts`)**: A dedicated service module handles all communication with the GitHub API endpoints for fetching user data, repositories, and workflows.
*   **State Management (`components/*.tsx`)**: React's component state and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) are used to manage the application's state, including the current user, selected repository, and active workflow run.
*   **Workflow Generation (`components/WorkflowGenerator.tsx`)**: When you generate a workflow, the app makes a `PUT` request to the GitHub API's `contents` endpoint to create a new `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your chosen repository.
*   **Live Updates (`components/WorkflowRunView.tsx`)**: The application uses a custom polling hook to periodically fetch the status of a workflow run and its associated job logs until the run is complete, providing a near real-time view of the process.
